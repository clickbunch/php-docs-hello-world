Surprise! It has been an emotional and confusing past couple of weeks, but I am here and life is movin'.</span><br><span style=""></span>  <span "font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;="" line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;times="" roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"="" style="">As I am sure many of you heard through the news, there was a terrorist attack against a Kenyan university and 147 people were murdered earlier in April. The terrorist group is an Islamic extremist group called Al-Shabaab from Somalia. It is assumed that the group was targeting Christians in their attack although there were Muslims who were killed as well in the attack.&nbsp;</span><span "font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;="" line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;times="" roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"="" style="">The news of the attack spread around the world pretty quickly and the students of UCU mourned for the victims and their families. I talked with my roommates, Mary, Doreen and Immaculate about Al-Shabaab that night asking each of them how they felt about Kenya neighboring Uganda, Uganda Christian University being one of the largest Christian universities in Uganda and about the terrorism that takes place around them. Each of them were very open and obviously upset about the killings in Kenya; however they assured me that we could not focus on terrorism too much or it would overwhelm our lives when there was nothing we could do about it anyway. “We must believe that God will protect us in moments of uncertainty” It was one of the most interesting and eye opening conversations that left me feeling helpless but at peace.</span><br><span style=""></span>  <span "font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;="" line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;times="" roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"="" style="">A few days after the Kenyan university attack there were supposed rumors that Al-Shabaab had threatened to attack schools along the Kampala-Jinja Road. Suddenly there were articles written with photos of soldiers supposedly on UCU’s campus prepared to fight. You may have seen them—they were not accurate. While the university took extra safety precautions, soldiers were not at UCU and the students and staff of UCU seemed to be very calm about the supposed threats.</span><br><span style=""></span>    <span "font-size:12.0pt;="" mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;times="" roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"="" style="">It was Easter weekend when word of these threats was released to the public and again when I asked my roommates about the situation they told me not to worry because these threats were very common and rarely anything would happen. I wasn't sure if that was a reason not to worry, but they were so calm about the situation it was hard to feel overly concerned. That morning we met with the directors of our program and they informed us that they were in constant communication with the U.S. Embassy and were trying to find where people had come across the threats. A few hours later however, we had another meeting and we were informed that the Uganda Studies Program was being terminated for the semester and that we all needed to return home within the following three days. As soon as this was announced, the room was overcome with silence and shock; hundreds of tears running down faces. It was a very heartbreaking moment. In short, the program was terminated because of chaos and worry in the United States coming from schools and families. Some schools and parents were demanding that their students come back to the United States as soon as possible. Obviously the Uganda Studies Program did not want schools, families and future students to think that the program did not take terrorism seriously, regardless if we were actually experiencing terrorism or not, and so it was decided by the president of CCCU to end the semester early. &nbsp;</span><br><span "font-size:12.0pt;="" mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;times="" roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"="" style="">The next couple of days were filled to the brim with packing, saying goodbyes, writing letters to people we wouldn't be able to say goodbye to, and simple moments with friends and families. </span><span "font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;="" line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;times="" roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"="" style="">Luckily my flight did not leave until Tuesday and I was able to visit my Mukono family, the Wandera family once more before I left for home. I spent Easter with them, and it was wonderful. We cooked, danced, ate and chatted. It was a relaxing Easter with my family and I was so thankful for my last moments with them before leaving Uganda. It was sad to say goodbye and try to explain to my little sisters that I was leaving to return to the United States. It was hard not to make promises to see them again, because I have no idea what will happen…</span><br><span style=""></span>  <span "font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;="" line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;times="" roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"="" style="">I was able to say goodbye to the majority of my team and campus friends, but I did not get to say goodbye to the students at Salama. I wrote the children and staff a letter and not being able to say goodbye to the children was heartbreaking. I guess I never realized how much I was relying on having another week and a half to say goodbye. I assumed we had time, I told the children we had time and when we didn’t it was hard to understand why. </span><br><span style=""></span>  <span "font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;="" line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;times="" roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"="" style="">My last night on campus I spent with my roommates Mary, Doreen and Immaculate. Imma and I planned a surprise tea and cake party and we feasted with lots of snacks and steamy tea. It was one of the best moments I had while living in Uganda. We laughed, cried, shared stories and encouraged one another. It was a moment I will never forget.</span><br><span style=""></span>  <span "font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;="" line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;times="" roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"="" style="">Saying goodbye to so many people so quickly was very hard. But trying to wrap my head around the fact that we (the Americans) were leaving because of supposed terrorist threats, and our friends and families had to stay, was heavy. What was right? I don’t think I will ever have answers for this. </span><br><span style=""></span>  <span "font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;="" line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;times="" roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"="" style="">I encourage everyone who was praying for my group to keep praying! Our prayers should not be limited by our nationality. There are still thousands of Christians at UCU living with these supposed threats that had <em style="">us</em> evacuated. Pray for Christians around the world, pray for Al-Shabaab—keep praying and don’t be so easily satisfied with a group of 30 American girls returning home because the fact of the matter is that our lives aren’t any more important than others. Keep praying.&nbsp;</span><br><span "font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;="" line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;times="" roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"="" style="">My semester in Uganda was one of the hardest, most rewarding things I have ever done. I have never learned more about myself, the world and God than I did while studying abroad. The world is an amazing place full of amazing people. I am forever thankful for the Uganda Studies Program and Uganda Christian University and I highly recommend USP and other Best Semester study abroad programs. Leaving the comfort of my school, family and friends and living in a completely different culture lead me to learn so much about who I am, what the world is actually like and so many of God's characteristics that I had never known before. IT'S ALL SO AMAZING! It is amazing that&nbsp;</span><span "font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;="" line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;times="" roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"="" style="">I have lived with Ugandan families, I have Ugandan brothers and sisters, Ugandan teammates and roommates, and Ugandan best friends!

The school is in Mukono (Where I am living) but the drive is about an hour long and every ride to the school proves to be dustier and dustier. The school is secluded and has an absolutely beautiful view of the valley surrounding it which fits with the school name Salama, meaning <em style="" "mso-bidi-font-style:="" normal"="">peaceful</em> in Kiswahili. </span><br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  <span style="" "font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;="" line-height:115%"="">There are about 80 children at the school ranging from P1 to P7 and each of them live with some sort of visual impairment whether they have been completely blind since birth or their eyesight is slowing failing as they grow older. When I was introduced to the staff members of the school I was very surprised to find that the majority of them were blind themselves! In fact, the headmaster of the school, Francis, is completely blind! Looking back I feel naïve to think that the school would be better run by another, but when I was first introduced to him I was shocked. Francis has been blind his whole life and he had made his life, which is seen as <em style="">useless</em> in the Ugandan culture, into a tool to help benefit the lives of others around him. </span><br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  <span style="" "font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;="" line-height:115%"="">Some of the teachers have been blind their whole lives, others have only been blind for a few years, some have eye sight only in one eye or a little in each and then there are one or two who have complete eye sight. The same is true with the students. </span><br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  <span style="" "font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;="" line-height:115%"="">Since being in Uganda I have been constantly starred at and judged because of the color of my skin. At Salama School for the Blind however, because the majority of the children cannot see me at all, none of them are scared and I have never been called a <em style="">Muzungu</em> (Kiswahili for white person). It has been refreshing and I feel accepted. The kids are absolutely wonderful!</span><br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  <span style="" "font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;="" line-height:115%"="">School here in Uganda is very different compared to school in the United States in many different ways. To start, families have to pay for their children to attend school and depending on the type of school the prices may be different. The lowest level of schooling is public schooling and is controlled by the government. When I asked my Papa Odongo (my village father) about school costs he said that government public schools cost around 90,000 shillings per semester which is about $33.00. There are 3 semesters in a year making the total school fee for a full year around $100.00. Unfortunately, the government run schools are not the best schools to send a child for education. In fact my Papa told me that he would rather have had the children stay home from school while I stayed with them because Jacob, Vincent and Pius would have learned more from me than their own teachers. He said that not only do the teachers only show up when the want to, but they often ‘cane’ the children as well. The environment of the public schools makes it difficult for the students to pass their exams and therefore difficult for their parents to keep investing in their schooling resulting in children never graduating from primary schooling (elementary and middle school). The private schools have better teachers but the cost of the semester increases drastically. My Papa said that some private schools can cost up to 800,000 shillings per semester! ($285.00) These schools are filled with Ugandan students whose families come from the upper-class population of Uganda. Jacob, Vincent and Pius go to a public school outside the village that cost around 130,000 to 140,000 shillings per semester ($45.00-$50.00) and their education is above average. The biggest asset the school offers is that the students learn English which is crucial in a child’s education in Uganda. The downside of the school however, is that it is much farther compared to the public schools which are within the village. Luckily, our papa has a boda-boda (most similar to a motorcycle) and is able to take the boys to school every day. Obviously having this type of transportation in the village is crucial for a child to receive a good education but realistically the majority of people living with the villages cannot afford a boda-boda. </span><br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  <span style="" "font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;="" line-height:115%"="">Anyway, Salama School for the Blind is unlike any of the private or public schools in Uganda because it is strictly for children who are visually impaired. The school is run privately but the school fees works differently compared to other schools in Uganda. One of the headmasters, Innocent, who has perfect eyesight and the biggest heart, told me that many of the children who attend the school come from families that cannot afford to send their children to school—especially a blind child, who are seen as useless in a community because he/she cannot contribute as much as others. If a parent has the choice to send either their blind child to school or their sighted child to school they will almost always send the child with full eyesight because they have a higher potential compared to the blind child. This is exactly what motivates Innocent to keep working for the blind children of Uganda. He says that he wants to be able to offer schooling to all blind children of Uganda. </span><br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  <span style="" "font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;="" line-height:115%"="">Because the majority of the children come from poorer families, they are usually not able to pay the school fees. Innocent said that he brings the children in anyway and that they will figure out how to pay for the children later. </span><br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  <span style="" "font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;="" line-height:115%"="">The children at Salama are completely capable of everything that children with perfect eyesight are. The children are often running, playing games, making dinner, washing clothes, fetching water, cleaning the bathrooms, delivering materials to the teachers, playing sports, playing instruments and making crafts. The kids recently have been learning how to make beaded bags and recycled paper necklaces. Their skills amaze me! </span><br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  <span style="" "font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;="" line-height:115%"="">I go to Salama two times a week for several hours and each time is a different experience. Sometimes Shannon (my classmate) and I will make posters, play games with the kids, help make crafts, clean or just hang out with the students. A couple weeks ago some of the older students (around Derek’s age) taught me how to read and write braille. The whole language is amazing and the children can write so quickly, it was amazing. The students are always asking Shannon and me crazy questions about our time here in Uganda and our lives back in the States. They all say they are coming to visit me, I told them I would make them pizza. </span><br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  <span style="" "font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;="" line-height:115%"="">Since being at Salama I have really come to appreciate the work of Francis, Innocent and the other staff members. They each stand for the blind students and believe that they will be of use to the Uganda community. They not only believe that all children should have the opportunity to receive education despite disabilities but they also make it happen. </span><br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  <span style="" "font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;="" line-height:115%"="">Salama has been a great experience so far! I will be sure to write of more stories and maybe even post a few photos; Innocent said he would send some soon!<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  <span style="" "font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;="" line-height:115%"="">Alright well that is it for now! Only a few more weeks of school and then we leave for a two week trip to Rwanda to learn about the culture and the genocide that took place there. This weekend we are taking a trip to Northern Uganda, Gulu where we will be learning about different NGOs. It should be really interesting!</span><br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  <span style="" "font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;="" line-height:115%"="">Anyway thank for reading about my adventure, I hope reading about my experience here in Uganda has given you a glimpse of this awesome country. </span><br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  <span style="" "font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;="" line-height:115%"="">&nbsp;</span><br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  <span style="" "font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;="" line-height:115%"="">Clare</span><br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  </span></div> <hr style="width:100%;clear:both;visibility:hidden;">

My Papa was 50 and my Mama Gracie was 30. I had two sisters who I never met because they were at boarding school, but their names were Patricia and Ester and they were 16 and 13. I also had three younger brothers; Jacob who was 12, Vincent who was 10 and Pius who was 6. I spent the majority of my time with them and they were so wonderful to me. <br><span></span><br><span></span>  It took about 2 days for the boys to finally get used to the fact that I was white. It wasn’t until tickling fights came into the equation when I think they just didn’t care anymore about my skin color. We had a lot of fun. They would take me from hut to hut to meet their friends, teach me about all the animals they had, and they absolutely loved playing with my camera and doing silly things. <br><span></span><br><span></span>  Within the first 15 minutes of my arrival, my mom taught me how to kill a chicken and although I did not actually kill the chicken I still felt responsible. Everything happened so fast I wasn’t even sure what was going on in the moment itself! My papa and my brothers thought my reaction was hilarious and every day after the slaughtering of the chicken they brought up a different kind of animal that they would have me slaughter for dinner. They thought it too funny. <br><span></span><br><span></span>  My mama was an amazing woman and although she doesn’t speak a word of English she loved me so well that words were not needed for me to feel comfortable. During the week the boys had school and my papa went to work his small shop he had in town so I spent the majority of the time with my mama. We would wake up, bucket bathe, have morning tea, and then crack ground nuts for hours. These days were very quiet, and very peaceful. As I mentioned before she is 30 years old and she have 5 children. This woman could have been one of my friends back in the states but here she was as my mama; she was a great mom. At the end of the week I gave her a purse as a gift and her reaction was priceless, I could have never imagined someone so happy to have received such a simple purse.<br><span></span><br><span></span>  When the boys would finally get home from school we would play soccer and a confusing and difficult form of hopscotch, fetch water and end our night in the dark, under the stars doing school work with the light of a small torch (flashlight). At night my dad would ask me every possible question he could as well as tell me all he could about the Attesso culture. <br><span></span><br><span></span>  One night my dad asked me what I would choose if I had the choice between living in the villages for the rest of my life or returning to my home in Michigan. I told him that I loved living in the villages with my new family but explained that I would have to go back home because I missed my Michigan family and friends too much. I don’t think he liked that answer because he said I didn’t understand the question and asked me again. I switched my wording around thinking that maybe he didn’t understand my answer because I was pretty sure I understood the question, hahah! He still was not satisfied and asked me one more time. I finally gave in and just told him that I would want to stay in the villages for the rest of my life. He liked that answer, smiled and went on about something else. He was quite the funny and stubborn man. <br><span></span><br><span></span>  The home stay was challenging at times. It was hard for my American busy mind and body to actually slow down and look around and reflect on what I have learned while being here in Uganda and also what I was learning in the moment. I took plenty of naps, finished Half the Sky and spent many hours in silence with my mama and ground nuts. I spent a lot of quality time with the boys and by the end of the week I really felt like they were my brothers. <br><span></span><br><span></span>  The most interesting thing that happened to me on my home stay was when the family cow tried to take a bucket bath with me in the corn stalk shower. I had to kick him out, literally. I think he had good intentions, but I just couldn’t share the shower with him. My family laughed and watched as the shower shook and the cow moo-ed. &nbsp;<br><span></span><br><span></span>  The morning I left was full of different emotions. I was excited to see all my friends and hear of their adventures but I was also so sad to say goodbye to my new family. Everyone woke up early, bathed and put on some of their best clothes! We all had morning tea together and ended breakfast with some traditional Ugandan dancing, the boys were so eager to teach me. I taught them the Macarena. They loved it! Before we knew it the van pulled into the driveway to take me away and the boys became so sad. We tried to take a photo all together but they boys would not smile. So I began tickling them and that seemed to work until I gave everyone hugs and climbed into the car. Jacob, Pius and Mama waved goodbye but Vincent walked over to the side of the house and cried with his head against the bricks. I lost it! It was heartbreaking. Of course my heart says I will see them again in the future, but I wonder if I really will. <br><span></span><br><span></span>  It’s only been a few days since I left and already my papa has called me telling me that the boys are not happy and that I need to talk to them on the phone. He said he would call back soon, so now I am just waiting to hear from them again. They are so precious to me. I am so thankful for my new family. <br><span></span><br><span></span>  After our home stays we took a 3 day trip to Sipi Falls which is absolutely beautiful! The SAU Uganda Cross Cultural trip stops by Sipi Falls, so this was my second time visiting. I never imagined I would be back at the falls, but I am so thankful I was because the falls are absolutely breathtaking and the 3 days with the USP staff and students was refreshing. We all exchanged our different stories, and debriefed about our experiences. It was needed and very enlightening hearing everyone’s questions and what they thought about certain characteristics of the home stay. We went hiking, visited a coffee plantation and had plenty of pillow talk. I love these girls and this program is awesome. <br><span></span><br><span></span>  Now I am back at school and trying to get back into the swing of things. Rainy season is coming and some days it will down pour here in Mukono for hours. The rain makes the air cold and it feels so nice not to be sweating all the time although our feet suffer from the mud. <br><span></span><br><span></span>  Today my team and I had a soccer game. We won, 1-0 of a PK. Almost all the girls are swimming in their uniforms because they are so big! The shorts go past my socks, and the girls tease that they can barely see my Muzungo skin (Muzungo = white person), I tease that U am a true African. Soccer here is much different, and our field is slanted but playing is still so much fun. Lately I have been playing center midfield with another UCU student named Dora. At the beginning of the season Dora really did not like me, I could tell. But now we are good friends and we play well together. She is a good player and could probably play at SAU. &nbsp;I have made some really great friends on the team and we are planning a trip to Kampala soon to get some American food and see if they like it. We have a lot of fun and I learn a lot from them! Some of them are helping me with Swahili and others are just helping me try to fit in. Hahaha, I really enjoy being on the soccer team. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><span></span><br><span></span>  This past week was great. Every day I get more used to living here in Uganda, and every day I miss home a little more. It’s always a roller coaster of emotions. <br><span></span><br><span></span>  Love you all.<br><span></span><br><span></span>  xo,<br><span></span><br><span></span>  Clare<br><span></span><br><span></span>  </span><span style=""></span><!--[if gte mso 9]>        <![endif]--></span></span></span></span></span></div>

 </div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><span style="text-decoration:none; font-style:normal; font-weight:400; color:rgb(70, 70, 70); "><span style="text-decoration:none; font-style:normal; font-weight:400; color:rgb(70, 70, 70); "></span><span style="font-size:16px;font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;">Hello family and friends! I am sorry it has taken me so long to blog but this week was very busy. Friday I finished my two week homestay with my family from Mukono. My brothers, sisters, aunts and parents took such good care of me and I plan to visit them throughout the rest of my time here! I learned so much from the homestay experience and I had some really good times with the family but I am so happy to be back on campus and finally have somewhat of a routine. </span><span style="font-size:16px;font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;">Sometimes it can be difficult for me to write about certain things because I am still processing and figuring out the experience even days after it has ended. I feel like the home stay experience is still something I am figuring out. </span><br><span></span><br><span></span><span style="font-size:16px;font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;">I was close to all my siblings but in different ways. I could talk to my older brother, Peter, pretty much about anything because we have similar things happening in our lives, only they are completely different because we live across the world from one another. Peter just graduated from college 2 weeks ago and he has been applying for different jobs. It was nice having Peter in the house because he would talk to me the most about the differences of Uganda and America. I learned a lot from him, and I think he learned a lot as well. It was really cool to be able to talk with someone for hours about how different our lives were, but still relate on smaller things. One thing Peter told me was that some churches in Uganda ban soccer from their church because people become too addicted to it! We talked about sorts of things ranging from food, education, income, social life, the church and many other differences within our cultures. &nbsp;</span><br><span></span><br><span></span><span style="font-size:16px;font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;">My younger siblings or just any of the kids that were always at the house, made my days really fun! We were always playing games, they would teach me simple Ugandan things, introduce me to </span><span style="font-size:16px;font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;">all</span><span style="font-size:16px;font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;"> their friends and they absolutely loved taking photos and videos, which I loved! My sister Chrissy who is 21 taught me how to cook! I can now make the perfect chapatti, matoke, irish, and of course beans and rice! The cooking takes literally all day. The women never stop cleaning and cooking. I can’t imagine if my days were a repeat of cooking and cleaning every day; yet this is how the majority of women around the world spend each day. It was humbling to say the least. I’ve always taken the stove, dishwasher, washing machine and dryer for granted until now. Life is hard here in Uganda, and I thought I understood that before this semester abroad but I don’t think I really did until the end of my home stay. I’m still learning. &nbsp;</span><br><span></span><br><span></span><span style="font-size:16px;font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;">My parents were not around as much as the children, but when I did get to talk to them they mostly wanted to educate me on all of Uganda. My dad works for World Vision and we had a really good talk one night about work and income in Uganda. I learned that even on the slow days working at Zehnders I make more than my dad. A lot of emotions came when I learned that, I’m not sure I can explain all of them. </span><br><span></span><br><span></span><span style="font-size:16px;font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;">Anyway, I am learning a lot in my classes as well. Every day I am learning more and more about college students over here and there are many more differences between us than I expected. For the past few years I have had the mindset that people are people where ever you go, as long as you meet core similarities that every person has, everything will be fine. That is a huge fairy tale! Life isn’t like that, and while having some similarities is nice to bond with, the fact of the matter is, is that Uganda and America are much different than one another. I am not Ugandan. I will never be Ugandan and there are some things I will never understand about their culture, and they will never understand about mine. I am starting to be okay with that, but at the beginning of the semester I felt so confused because everything I thought I knew about Uganda and the people here seemed to be different than what I thought coming into the semester. </span><br><span></span><br><span></span><span style="font-size:16px;font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;">I am also learning a lot about myself and who I am when I am in uncomfortable situations. Let’s just say I have had to give myself an attitude adjustment more than once this past month. I’ve always been a firm believer that your days rely on your perspective, but I guess I have never had to shift my perspective so drastically and so quickly. It has been really good for me, but it is a constant struggle and decision I have had to deal with every day.</span><br><span></span><br><span></span><span style="font-size:16px;font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;">Finally, I am learning a lot about God and who he is here in Uganda. Haha, I am not sure how to even write this, but he is much different than the God in America yet he is similar sometimes. Church services are much different than the United States and sometimes I really have to remind myself that we are worshiping the same God, just in very different ways. There is something really scary and really awesome about that to me. As the days have gone on I become more and more comfortable that God may look very different to someone here than to someone in America and they can both be followers of Jesus. It is cool but also very overwhelming and difficult to fully understand. The more I learn the more I realize I may never understand, and the longer I confront that issue, the more comfortable I become with it. &nbsp;</span><br><span></span><br><span></span><span style="font-size:16px;font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;">In lighter news! I am getting really good at killing bugs, making my bed perfectly, washing my clothes in a timely manner and I am officially on UCU’s Women’s Soccer Team! Wahooo!!! On Friday I was given a pair of soccer socks and accepted onto the team! The girls are very nice, practice was a lot of fun and I am so excited to finally be playing again and meeting new friends! We practice every day from 5-7 and this week we have our first scrimmage of the semester! </span><br><span></span><br><span></span><span style="font-size:16px;font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;">I have almost been in Uganda for a full month and I can confidently write to you all letting you know that I am finally getting the hang of living over here. Every day I am amazed that I am actually living in Uganda! Every day I am meeting new friends and learning amazing things about the world. Thank you so much for your thoughts and prayers. Simply knowing that I have you all supporting me across the world really makes my heart happy! </span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><span style="font-size:16px;font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;">Love you all so much! Talk to you soon! </span><br><span></span><br><span></span><span style="font-size:16px;font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;">Clara </span><span style=""><br></span><span style=""></span><span style=""><span style=""></span></span></span></div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-thin" style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center">

				<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><span style="text-decoration:none; font-style:normal; font-weight:400; color:rgb(70, 70, 70); "><span style="text-decoration:none; font-style:normal; font-weight:400; color:rgb(70, 70, 70); ">22. January 2015<br><span></span><br><span></span>  I am not even sure where to start. This past week has been challenging, eye opening, emotional, exciting, humbling and really hard. <br><span></span><br><span></span>  On Saturday USP dropped each of the on-campus students off at their home stay where we would be living for two weeks. With no background information on the families we would be living with, they dropped us off at our separate houses, took a picture of us with our parents and then drove off to the next house to drop off another student. It was frightening not knowing anything and watching the people I had become so comfortable with drive away to another house knowing I wouldn’t see them till class Monday morning. IT WAS SCARY OKAY?!<br><span></span><br><span></span>  When I arrived at my house, I was greeted by my sister Chrissy, who is the same age as me, but in my confusion and fear I thought she was my mother until she informed me that her parents (our parents) thought I was not coming till the evening, and were not home. So that was a bit awkward, but the rest of the family didn’t seem to mind and there were <strong>11 </strong>other family members. In total, there are 13 people in my family not including myself. I have a grandmother, two aunts, a mother, a father, an older brother Peter (24years), a sister Chrissy (21years), a quiet and soccer-loving brother Emma (15years), a sweet sister Ester (13years), a sneaky brother Matthew (7years), a crazy sister Peace (5), the adorable family friend Christo (5years), and the grandbaby of the family, who is to call me ‘mom’, Michelle (2years) she is afraid of me. <br><span></span><br><span></span>  Saturday was a bit overwhelming and a bit awkward because no one was expecting me and the family speaks mostly in Luganda so I couldn’t contribute to their conversations like I thought I would be able to. The kids seemed timid of me, but because I am older than most of them, they would serve me food and tea and were so polite. Saturday was a long day and I went to bed worried that the coming two weeks would be the longest of my life. <br><span></span><br><span></span>  Sunday was much better, we went to church for about four hours. The church was Pentecostal and I have never been to a Pentecostal church even in America so the culture shock was thick Sunday morning. My dad is one of the pastors there and he is an amazing man of God. My mother and sister Chrissy are Sunday school teachers, so for the majority of the service I was by myself. <br><span></span><br><span></span>  After church and my bucket bath, which is my daily ‘shower’ from a bucket of water, I felt 100xs better about my home stay. I am really not sure why but my attitude was completely flipped from scared and worried to outgoing and excited. Sunday night was wonderful with the family. The kids and I played for hours, we watched movies, they taught me some Luganda, we danced and we ended the night with sharing what we had learned from church and prayer. My host father and mother even called my mom and dad back in the United States to assure them that I was doing well and was in safe hands. They are so sweet and it was really nice to talk to my mom and dad with my host parents. <br><span></span><br><span></span>  My walk to school is about 25 minutes and I leave around 7am in the morning to avoid the heat, regardless I am always sweating by the time I arrive at school. My walk is safe and I am always meeting new students on my way.<br><span></span><br><span></span>  Besides my home stay other exciting things have been happening as well! To start, I am officially going to be interning at Salama the school for the blind! I start tomorrow and I am so excited. Also, I am going to be playing with the UCU soccer team here on campus! This week I met the team of girls and they were all so friendly. I will start when I am done with my home stay. Today was my first class of Swahili, it was difficult and I will have to practice a lot! Oh! And this weekend some girls and I will be going to Kampala, the capital of Uganda to go buy spaghetti sauce so we can make a spaghetti dinner for our families. <br><span></span><br><span></span>  This week has been crazy, and I am learning so much from Uganda and my stay here. Every day is a roller coaster of emotions. I am learning so much academically, socially, personally and I am becoming more and more humbled by every experience. <br><span></span><br><span></span>    Thank you for your thoughts and prayers! Know that I am safe and really taking in every moment here. I will talk to you all soon! <br><span></span><br><span></span>    Clara<br><span></span><br><span></span>    <!--[if gte mso 9]>        <![endif]--></span></span></div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-thin" style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="./index_files/9023985_orig.jpg" alt="Picture" style="width:100%;max-width:478px"> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>

I had my Religions in Contemporary Uganda today for three hours and it seems as if it is going to be a really interesting class! Since our professors are Ugandan there are sometimes language barriers and today several people asked the same question in a different manner in attempts to use language that would make sense to our professor. It was quite funny, and we did finally come to a conclusion. Overall though, the professors speak very good English, we just use different words at times. It is really fun having them teach us, they are so smart and very serious about their profession. Each professor takes every minute of the three hours they have with us. <br><span></span><br><span></span>  This Saturday we leave the university to go live with host families in Mukono town for two weeks. USP is picking us up at the university at 10am and dropping each of us off at our different homestays and letting us take care of the rest. I won’t know who my family is until I walk through the door and meet them! I hope I have brothers and sisters to hang out with! Over these two weeks I will still be attending my classes, I will just be walking to school and walking back after my classes and homework. I will be experiencing how many Ugandans live! I will be sure to keep you all updated on what my homestay is like. <br><span></span><br><span></span>  Here are some funny and interesting things about Uganda I have learned and experienced so far:<br><span></span><br><span></span>  o&nbsp;&nbsp; The showers are more like hoses with freezing cold water coming from the wall and I have actually come to get quite use to them! <br><span></span><br><span></span>  o&nbsp;&nbsp; Ugandans know how to make their beds perfectly and even had to teach me. <br><span></span><br><span></span>  o&nbsp;&nbsp; When someone sneezes Ugandans do not say, ‘bless you’. They will just look at you funny if you bless them after their sneeze. <br><span></span><br><span></span>  o&nbsp;&nbsp; The bugs are 10xs bigger here and like to live in my clothing…<br><span></span><br><span></span>  o&nbsp;&nbsp; The sun is hotter and fries my white skin!<br><span></span><br><span></span>  o&nbsp;&nbsp; My new roommate, Mark, is a violent sleeper and a snorer. <br><span></span><br><span></span>  o&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though it is very hot here in Uganda, the drink of choice is hot tea.<br><span></span><br><span></span>  o&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ugandan students do not accept wrinkled clothing and iron everything, including bath towels! <br><span></span><br><span></span>  o&nbsp;&nbsp; My roommates say that white people look funny with their hair braided. I told her I was doing it anyway. <br><span></span><br><span></span>  Today we applied for our practicums. I am really excited and hope to get into the practicum I want. I requested to be placed at a school called Salama. Salama is a school for the blind children of Uganda. My second choice was another blind school (Chain) and my third was an ECL program here on UCU’s campus. All the practicum sites sounded amazing, but I was really interested in the schools for the blind for some reason. I am anxious to see if I will be selected! <br><span></span><br><span></span>  The time difference between my friends, family in the US and Cody who is in Cambodia, is really interesting to figure out. I wish I could talk to everyone more, or talk on the phone, but it has been difficult to find time. Hopefully I will get the hang of everything and communication will become easier. My dad has been texting me, and sending me voice messages and photos at 5:00am over here, haha! (no wonder I don’t need an alarm.) But anyway, I miss you guys and love reading your replies, posts and emails or whatever! <br><span></span><br><span></span>  Talk to you soon with all the updates on my homestay and also my practicum! <br><span></span><br><span></span>    <!--[if gte mso 9]>        <![endif]--></span></span></span></span></div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-thin" style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="./index_files/8575680_orig.jpg" alt="Picture" style="width:100%;max-width:960px"> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>

				<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><span style="text-decoration:none; font-style:normal; font-weight:400; color:rgb(70, 70, 70); "></span></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><span style="text-decoration:none; font-style:normal; font-weight:400; color:rgb(70, 70, 70); "><span style="text-decoration:none; font-style:normal; font-weight:400; color:rgb(70, 70, 70); ">  We are finally here, and let me tell you it was not as easy as we thought it would be… Overall our travel went fairly well until we landed in Nairobi, Kenya where Emilia was stopped at a temperature monitor because her body temperature was warmer than the average person walking into the airport (Ebola precautions we think). After 25 minutes of drenching her in water she finally passed the monitor and we stood in a line and waited for another 25 minutes only to find out we were in the wrong line! With only 10 minutes left until our plane left, we ran through the airport asking whoever was available for directions. After a slow bus drive by a very chatty Kenyan and directions to the wrong terminal we finally found where we were supposed to be and right on time. I think all three of us thought we would be spending the night in the Nairobi airport. But have no fear! After many hours of travel we are finally in Mukono at the Uganda Christian University! The campus is so beautiful and much bigger than Spring Arbor. I have missed this country.<br><span></span><br><span></span>  &nbsp;I live in the Sabiti Hall with three Ugandan roommates. So far I have met Mary (23years) and Dooreen&nbsp; (22years)v and the other will be arriving shortly they say. Mary has been here since I have been on campus and she is the sweetest person I have ever met. She is so caring and so concerned about my adjustment here at USU. She is a sweetheart. Dooreen I met today and she is sassssss-ay! I love it! She is an amazing singer and told me that her songs are inspired by her mother who recently died two months ago from a sickness. She explained that the sickness her mother had brought shame and isolation to her family, but they survived by relying on Jesus. Her songs are so beautiful they bring me to tears; even listening to her hum is relaxing. I am anxious to meet the third roommate, she is also my bunkmate and I have been trying my best to keep my section of the room clean so that I do not embarrass them. This is hard, and today I was taught how to make my bed properly… But since the beginning Mary has treated me so special. I have the best roommate I think! Mary has a best friend and her name is Hellema and she is the RA of anther floor. She is very outgoing and also Mary and I’s personal alarm clock every morning at 7:30 where we wake up and go get morning tea and chat. She says that Mary and I are lazy and not good with time because we do not wake up on time. This morning she called Mary before she came in to warn us, and then came running into our room singing my name telling me to rise and not be slow, HAHAH! They are so funny together and promised they would teach me Swahili if I teach them how to play soccer. That’s a deal! I told them we will start by joining the honors college on their 6:00am jogs every morning. They laughed and said they cannot run, so I am thinking soccer will be interesting. <br><span></span><br><span></span>  Our room is pretty small; we have two desks, two closets, four small book shelves and 4 beds that are bunked. The Uganda Studies Program gave me a trunk and lock to keep all my valuables, but I have so much stuff that anything that doesn’t fit in my closet goes into the trunk as well. I am still getting organized and I am sure I will figure it out soon.<br><span></span><br><span></span>  Our classes start on Monday, and we do not get our schedule until tomorrow night, Sunday, so I am not even sure what my schedule looks like yet. Today we got wifi for the first time. So far it seems pretty inconsistent and it is only available in some spots of the campus. <br><span></span><br><span></span>  Mary and Dooreen are sponsored through Compassion International and I wish I had a video of Mary talking about how blessed, humbled and eternally thankful she is for the organization and the family that sponsors her so that she can attend USU. Mary is so wonderful and I am so thankful for the family who sponsors her as well. I took some notes while she was telling me how she felt about Compassion International and here are some of the things she said: Mary explained that one of the best days that she could have in her life would be to meet her sponsor family. She told me that she enjoys writing to them and sending them photos because her sponsor family has blessed her with a future, one that the Lord has chosen for her because of his great love for her. She said that she will be eternally thankful and eternally humbled by Compassion International and all the people around the world who are sponsoring children. <br><span></span><br><span></span>  Mary is the sweetest, and it was enlightening and encouraging to talk with her about her experience with international sponsorship all the way through her schooling to her last semester of university. With all this said, sponsorship is making a huge difference especially here at Uganda Christian University where a large percentage of the students here are sponsored. <br><span></span><br><span></span>  The last two days all the USP students have been going through orientation and registration. It has been very good so far and we are all really excited to start our classes. Also, a B- in the states is considered A material work here in Uganda… The way I see it that could either be very motivating because I could actually get my first 4.0, or very demotivating for obvious reasons... But don’t worry mom and dad, I am going for the 4.0. <br><span></span><br><span></span>  The USP students are wonderful. I have already made some really good friends and we have had some really good late night and cold shower conversations. I am so thankful for them. I have grown already in the three days I have been here and I was not exactly expecting that, in fact I didn’t think I would have so much to say for my first blog post while here in Uganda. I was very wrong. <br><span></span><br><span></span>  I feel very safe here at the University. Everyone is so friendly and helpful to us. Uganda is a wonderful place and I cannot wait to tell you more! <br><span></span><br><span></span>    <!--[if gte mso 9]>        <![endif]--></span></span></div>  <div><div style="height: 20px; overflow: hidden; width: 100%;"></div> <hr class="styled-hr" style="width:100%;"> <div style="height: 20px; overflow: hidden; width: 100%;"></div></div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-thin" style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:left"> <a> <img src="./index_files/2707207_orig.jpg" alt="Picture" style="width:auto;max-width:100%"> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>

				<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Well, tomorrow I leave for a four month study abroad program to Mukono University in Southern Uganda.<br>I am not much of a blogger, so I can't promise I will be blogging my everyday life; however, I will do my best to share some of my adventures and challenges with you if you care to read.&nbsp;<br><br>Because I am assuming the majority of people reading this blog will be my family I just want to clarify a few things.&nbsp;<br>1. I will be safe, and I will be smart.&nbsp;<br>2. I will take my medications and I will be sleeping under a mosquito net.&nbsp;<br>3. Ebola is not an issue in Uganda.&nbsp;<br><br><span style="">I am traveling with two other students from SAU and will meet with 25-30 American students while at the University.</span><br><br>While in Uganda I will be taking 18 credits: 6 credits of the Swahili language, COR400, World Religions and a small practicum that I will be assigned when I arrive. I am really excited for my classes!<br><span style="background-color: initial;"><span style="line-height: 23.3999996185303px;">I will be living on campus with a roommate, but I will also be part of a two week&nbsp;</span>home stay<span style="line-height: 23.3999996185303px;">&nbsp;where I will live outside of the university with a Ugandan family!&nbsp;</span></span><br>Some of my personal plans include getting my hair braided, visiting Jinja to meet our sponsor child, Livingstone and going white water rafting on the Nile!!!<br><br>So there you have it, my semester abroad plans in a few paragraphs.&nbsp;<br>I will keep you all updated with exciting happenings and many photos!&nbsp;<br><br>XO,<br>Clara</div>
